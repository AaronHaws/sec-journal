# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week? Once i knew what to look for, and how to implement it into the code in our ops challenges i felt accomplished. It just took a little nudge to know what and where to look.
- What did you learn as a shock or surprise? In our ops challenges we have been dealing with Bash and just knowing the different ways to implement a variable and function was pretty surprising. Im enjoying finding the different ways that the code can be used around my system.
- What are you struggling with? The syntax languages for each different code is incredibly hard to understand for me. its what im really interested in but i find it the hardest to learn.
- What would you count as a victory? Just getting through every day, I sometimes get incredibly anxious when reading the assignments and what i need to do. but with the help of classmates and just sticking to it and trying my hardest i make it through everyday.
