## Questions

- What is the ShellShocked Attack?
  - Answer Here: it is a bug that was implemented early on in the code of Bash that nobody could have predicted being an attack much later on down the road. it is a vulnerability that allows the execution of arbitrary command given certain conditions.
- How can you ensure your environment is protected from ShellShocked?
  - Answer Here: update your bash 
- Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment: Pretty wild how the guy who spent the time writing the code for bash had to drive it across the country because of the limitations of his current technology and lack of the web.
