# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week? i really think the raspberry pi was my favorite and i seemed to have little to no problems when i had my notes
- What did you learn as a shock or surprise? the dual booting was a surprise but also running the PI as a server is pretty rad.
- What are you struggling with? honestly i feel like when im in class everything goes smooth. but when i go home the VS code gives me hell and i seem to spend more time stressing about the homework than i do in class.
- What would you count as a victory? learning to make the network cables. first one didnt really work out but after a few tips and being more confident i was able to bust out the second cable pretty fast and smoothly.
