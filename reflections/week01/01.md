## Questions

  Aaron HAws 11/15/21
- Summarize what you learned from the China's Spy Chip Reading:
  the surprising thing is how many hardware clients they could possibly be in. From healthcare, financial, to even the company reporting the story, Bloomberg. I was also struck with how they got away with bribing or even threatening the chinese subcontractors to get their malicious hardware into the motherboards. I was happy to see that the American government was able to see what could happen in hardware and has now a plan in action to find and investigate these malicious products.
- Answer the following questions
  - What is a CPU and Cores:
  A CPU or Central Processing Unit, is the core component that defines a computing device. And performs many processing functions for the system.
  A Core is the processor for the CPU that can control certain tasks, the more cores the more tasks performed.
  - What is RAM why do computers use it.:
  RAM is Random Access Memory. Your computer RAM is essentially short term memory where data is stored as the processor needs it
- Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment: My takeaway is largely from the reading material, even if your software is secure your hardware might be malicious from the begining of manufacturing from a subcontractor of the original manufacturer.
