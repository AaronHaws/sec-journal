# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week? I was pretty happy with the batch scripting part of the week, thought that was fun.
- What did you learn as a shock or surprise? I have several devices that deploy payloads with Notepad and wasnt aware of how easy the batch script was.
- What are you struggling with? i seemed to have regresses with the NMAP tool, i thought i was ok with it but the cyber range threw me for a loop.
- What would you count as a victory? getting through the week again.s
