## Questions

- What are the five Guiding Principles of an SOP? Keep it simple,SOP's must be portable, Flowcharts and diagrams tell a story, consistancy counts, and its about the audience.
- Which principle do you believe is most important and why? Its all about the audience, if you cant portray your SOP to someone who has never seen it, then your SOP failed.
- Why are System Images important? it is a complete snapshot of your OS at a certain time wich can help you weed out the problem that happened to your system at a certain time.
- Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment. I have written or edited several SOP's in the brewing industry but most of the time i was talking to a person who i had imagined was in my possition, who had my experience. if i could go back i would write it as if they were brand new on the job and needed a detailed breakdown of the procedure.
