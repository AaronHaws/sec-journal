## Questions

- What is Event Tracing? How can it me useful? Event tracing is a Windows logging mechanism for troubleshooting and diagnostics of the events running on your OS. its useful for tracing a ton of events that are run by the OS every hour to see if the events are even needed or useful in anyway. or if they are malicious events not added by the OS or administrator.
- What is Windows Hello? What are some of it's benefits and drawbacks? Its the facial recognition log on that starts after the boot up of the OS. you can also choose to use a pin or password. the benefits are purely convenience of use. the ability to open up your laptop and bee logged on is very convenient, but the fact that you have a map of your face or webcam permissions storred somewhere on your OS is probably not a good idea.
- Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment. Being able to design a script that goes through your Windows Event Viewer and can point out certain events or with other filters, for your benefit is really cool to me.
