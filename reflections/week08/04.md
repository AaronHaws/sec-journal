## Questions
- Kerberos is a protocol for authenticating service requests between trusted hosts on an untrusted network. It is a default protocol for windows since 2000. It was developed at MIT so the users could communicate securely over the internet for services they needed to use. Before Kerberos passwords were transmitted unencrypted over a network. The authentication information is stored on centralized authentication servers, with application servers being held separately. Kerberos provides a mechanism for clients and servers to set up an encrypted circuit so that networked communications are private. It works by a server authentication request and response and a ticket request and response and then an application server request and response. Kerberos is the fundamental authentication service for the internet.
