## Questions

- Summarize the reading

The article describes the difference in Windows os and Windows Server. With the server being able to be deployed without a gui there is a big difference right there. But the server provides services for other users to be able access over the network. Windows server though has some missing features while Windows itself has features like cortana or Edge the server still uses IE. Windows itself though is a more familiar experience even though it lacks server like features.
